Won't be able to come to the on-site events? Or maybe coding is your passion and you always want more problems to solve? If yes, then this online event is for you. Gear up and get ready for a bout of coding on your favourite coding platform CodeChef and stand a chance to win exciting cash prizes from the comfort of your home. Are you up for the challenge?
This is truly a one-of-a-kind fun event where both the team members get different questions to solve. After some time, the questions are exchanged. But the catch is, you cannot interact with your partner or change their previous code! Use your skills, knowledge and teamwork to solve at least one full question as the clock ticks by.
