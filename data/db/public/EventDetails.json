It is expected that competitors stay within the rules and procedures of their own accord and do not require constant policing.</li><li>Special care should be taken to protect the on-board batteries and pneumatics, robot without proper protection will not be allowed to compete.</li><li>If you have a robot or weapon design that does not fit within the categories set forth in these rules or is in some way ambiguous or borderline, please contact the event organizers. Safe innovation is always encouraged, but surprising the organizers with your brilliant exploitation of a loophole may cause your robot to be disqualified before it even competes.</li><li>Each event has safety inspections. It is at their sole discretion that your robot is allowed to compete. As a builder you are obligated to disclose all operating principles and potential dangers to the inspection staff.</li><li>Proper activation and deactivation of robots is critical.
