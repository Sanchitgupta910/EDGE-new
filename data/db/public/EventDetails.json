It is expected that competitors stay within the rules and procedures of their own accord and do not require constant policing.</li><li>Special care should be taken to protect the on-board batteries and pneumatics, robot without proper protection will not be allowed to compete.</li><li>If you have a robot or weapon design that does not fit within the categories set forth in these rules or is in some way ambiguous or borderline, please contact the event organizers. Safe innovation is always encouraged, but surprising the organizers with your brilliant exploitation of a loophole may cause your robot to be disqualified before it even competes.</li><li>Each event has safety inspections. It is at their sole discretion that your robot is allowed to compete. As a builder you are obligated to disclose all operating principles and potential dangers to the inspection staff.</li><li>Proper activation and deactivation of robots is critical.

The amount of sticks used in the bridge is limited only by the Dimensions and Weight restrictions.During the strength test of the bridge, one horizontal bar will be placed on the road deck of the bridge. A downward force will be applied onto the horizontal bar. By placing the bar on the deck in this manner, we ensure that the truss members of the bridge are stressed during the strength test.

This force will be recorded on the Evaluation Sheet. A bridge is considered to fail when at least one member of the bridge breaks. During the test, the bridge will rest on two blocks placed apart. These blocks are loose and will resist the downward force applied to the bridge. The Strength Factor will be computed using the formula:<br><br>Efficiency = (applied force)/(self weight of the bridge)<br><br>The bridge with the highest Strength Factor will be given a score of 100.
